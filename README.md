## What is it ?
It's a game based on the episode #97 of the show "Salut les Geeks" from Mathieu Sommet. The goal : click on the garbages before they hit the ground. Once you let 10 garbages pass, you lose. All the images and sounds are from the episode of SLG by Mathieu Sommet. The font I used is the same that Mathieu used in the episode, it's 100% free and downloadable on dafont.

## How did you code it ?
I used the Java language along with the (JSFML)[http://jsfml.org/] library, Java binding of the (SFML)[http://www.sfml-dev.org] library.
